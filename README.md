Post to `/create` with the `url` field to create.

- If a field is missing or incorrect, status `400` is returned with a JSON
body (`error` key)
- If a problem saving the URL occurs, a status `500` is returned.
- If the url is created, status `200` is returned with JSON body (`short` key)
- If the url already exists, same response as creation is returned.
